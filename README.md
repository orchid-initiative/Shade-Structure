# Shade Structures (Shade-Structure)

### Summary
A Spanish-speaking renter in Alhambra used to have a tarp for shade and storage, but the city said it had to go. It wasn’t a great solution, but it was what she had.  We’re working with her and the city to see if there’s a better option that meets everyone’s goals.

### Status
