# Project Charter 

## Executive Summary
A Spanish-speaking renter in Alhambra used to have a tarp for shade and storage, but the city said it had to go. It wasn’t a great solution, but it was what she had. We’re working with her and the city to see if there’s a better option that meets everyone’s goals.

## Project Goals
- Help the renter regain functional, dignified outdoor space for shade and storage  
- Explore city-approved alternatives that are realistic for renters and property owners  
- Strengthen communication and trust between residents and the city’s code enforcement staff  
- Document the process so others in similar situations might benefit  

## Deliverables
TBD

## Business Case / Background

**Why are we doing this?**

A neighbor’s basic outdoor setup—used for shade and storage—was taken down after code enforcement concerns. She’s a Spanish-speaking renter with limited options and no easy way to navigate the process. Her landlord was trying to help but didn’t know what would be allowed. When we went to the city, we ended up talking directly with the officer who wrote the citation. He told us, “I’m not a villain.” That stuck with us. It made us wonder what could happen if we treated this not as a standoff, but as a shared problem we could work on together.

This project is small on purpose. It’s not a campaign or a policy push. We’re starting with one person, one home, and one problem. But we’re also treating it as a test case: what happens when someone wants to do the right thing but doesn’t have a clear way to do it?

Our hope is to find something practical, dignified, and workable—something that reflects the shared goals of the renter, the landlord, and the city. If it ends up being useful to others later on, even better.

**In-Scope:**

TBD, but maybe:
- One renter’s outdoor space
